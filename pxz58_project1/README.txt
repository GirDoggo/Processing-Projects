The program can be run simply by pressing the run button after opening the
.pde file. The image to be displayed and filtered can be changed by typing in the file name of any image in the data folder 
into the name of the variable photo. After running the program, the displayed photo can be filtered with any of 5 filters:
grayscale, sharpen, gaussian blur, edge detection, or red-green colorblindness. These can be selected with the number keys
1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 respectively.
The program also has the ability to apply a custom-generated kernel of any size. This custom size is set by typing an odd
number greater than 1 into the defnition of the variable u.
To toggle use of the custom blur kernel, the 'f' key on the keyboard is used. This same key, when pressed again, will toggle
the use of the custom kernel off, applying the original, standard gaussian blur kernel again when the 3 key is pressed. 
Finally, the image displayed can be displayed as the original, unfiltered image by pressing the key 0.
